# MDADM Library Manual

## Introduction
Introducing our library: it's a powerful tool that can help you perform a wide range of tasks quickly and efficiently. Whether you're working with data processing, machine learning, or other computationally intensive tasks, our library is designed to simplify your workflow and help you get the results you need.

### Key Features
- **Caching:** Improves performance by storing frequently used data in memory for fast access. This can be particularly useful when working with large datasets or running complex algorithms that require a lot of computation.
- **Remote JBOD Access:** Allows you to access and work with data stored on remote servers as if they were local, eliminating the need to transfer data back and forth physically.

## Function: `mdadm_mount()`
### Description
The `mdadm_mount()` function is designed to mount all the disks in the JBOD.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_mount(void);
```

### Parameters
- This function takes no parameters.

### Return Value
- **1 on success:** Indicates that the disks were successfully mounted.
- **-1 on failure:** Indicates that the disks are already mounted.

### Usage Example
```c
int result = mdadm_mount(); 
if (result == 1) {
    printf("Disks were successfully mounted.\n");
} else if (result == -1) {
    printf("Disks are already mounted.\n");
} else {
    printf("An error occurred while
