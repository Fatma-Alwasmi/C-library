mdadm_cache_create()`

### Description
The `mdadm_cache_create()` function is used to allocate space for a cache of `num_entries` entries, where each entry is of type `cache_entry_t`. This function returns `1` on success and `-1` on failure. It is the function that users should call if they want to use read caching for improved performance.

It's important to note that calling `mdadm_cache_create()` again without first calling `mdadm_cache_destroy()` will result in failure. Also, it's important to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()` at the end to avoid memory leaks.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_cache_create(int num_entries);
```

### Parameters
- `num_entries`: The number of cache entries to be allocated. This parameter is of type `int`.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_cache_create()` function returns an integer value. It returns `1` on success and `-1` on failure.

### Usage
Here's an example usage of the `mdadm_cache_create()` function:

```c
int result = mdadm_cache_create(100); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Failed to create cache.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Cache created successfully.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we're calling `mdadm_cache_create()` with `num_entries` set to 100. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the cache was created successfully or not. If it was, we print a success message to the console.

It's important to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()` at the end of your program to avoid memory leaks:

```c
mdadm_cache_destroy();
```

If you forget to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()`, your program may experience memory leaks.

## Function: `mdadm_cache_destroy()`

### Description
The `mdadm_cache_destroy()` function is used to free the space that was previously allocated by the `mdadm_cache_create()` function. This function returns `1` on success and `-1` on failure.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_cache_destroy(void);
```

### Parameters
This function doesn't take any parameters.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_cache_destroy()` function returns an integer value. It returns `1` on success and `-1` on failure.

### Usage
Here's an example usage of the `mdadm_cache_destroy()` function:

```c
int result = mdadm_cache_destroy(); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Failed to destroy cache.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Cache destroyed successfully.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we're calling `mdadm_cache_destroy()` to free the space allocated by the `mdadm_cache_create()` function. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the cache was destroyed successfully or not. If it was, we print a success message to the console.

It's important to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()` at the end of your program to avoid memory leaks:

```c
mdadm_cache_destroy();
```

If you forget to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()`, your program may experience memory leaks.

## Function: `mdadm_connect()`

### Description
The `mdadm_connect()` function is used to connect to a server using the provided IP address and port number. This function returns `true` if the connection was successful, and `false` otherwise. It is important to call the `mdadm_disconnect()` function after a successful connection.

### Syntax
```c
bool mdadm_connect(const char *ip, uint16_t port);
```

### Parameters
The `mdadm_connect()` function takes two parameters:

- `ip`: A string containing the IP address of the server to connect to.
- `port`: An unsigned 16-bit integer representing the port number to use for the connection.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_connect()` function returns a boolean value. It returns `true` if the connection was successful, and `false` otherwise.

### Usage
Here's an example usage of the `mdadm_connect()` function:

```c
if (mdadm_connect("192.168.1.100", 1234)) { 
    printf("Connected to server.\n"); 
 
    // Perform operations on the server here. 
 
    mdadm_disconnect(); 
} else { 
    printf("Failed to connect to server.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we're calling `mdadm_connect()` to connect to a server with IP address "192.168.1.100" and port number 1234. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the connection was successful or not. If it was, we print a success message to the console, perform any necessary operations on the server, and then call `mdadm_disconnect()` to disconnect from the server.

It's important to call `mdadm_disconnect()` after a successful connection to ensure that the connection is properly closed and resources are freed:

```c
mdadm_disconnect();
```

If you forget to call `mdadm_disconnect()`, your program may experience issues such as resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Function: `mdadm_disconnect()`

### Description
The `mdadm_disconnect()` function is used to disconnect from a server that was previously connected to using the `mdadm_connect()` function.

### Syntax
```c
void mdadm_disconnect(void);
```

### Parameters
The `mdadm_disconnect()` function takes no parameters.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_disconnect()` function does not return a value.

### Usage
Here's an example usage of the `mdadm_disconnect()` function:

```c
if (mdadm_connect("192.168.1.100", 1234)) { 
    printf("Connected to server.\n"); 
 
    // Perform operations on the server here. 
 
    mdadm_disconnect(); 
} else { 
    printf("Failed to connect to server.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we're calling `mdadm_connect()` to connect to a server with IP address "192.168.1.100" and port number 1234. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the connection was successful or not. If it was, we print a success message to the console, perform any necessary operations on the server, and then call `mdadm_disconnect()` to disconnect from the server.

It's important to call `mdadm_disconnect()` after a successful connection to ensure that the connection is properly closed and resources are freed:

```c
mdadm_disconnect();
```

If you forget to call `mdadm_disconnect()`, your program may experience issues such as resource leaks or unexpected behavior.
