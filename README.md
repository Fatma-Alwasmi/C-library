# mdadm Library Manual

Introducing our library: it's a powerful tool that can help you perform a wide range of tasks quickly and efficiently. Whether you're working with data processing, machine learning, or other computationally intensive tasks, our library is designed to simplify your workflow and help you get the results you need.

One of the key features of our library is caching, which helps to improve performance by storing frequently used data in memory for fast access. This can be particularly useful when working with large datasets or when running complex algorithms that require a lot of computation. With our caching system, you can speed up your workflow and get your results faster than ever before.

In addition to caching, our library also supports working with remote JBOD servers. This means that you can access and work with data stored on remote servers as if they were part of your local system, without needing to physically transfer files or data back and forth. This can be particularly useful if you're working with large data sets that are too big to store on your local machine.

Overall, our library is a versatile and powerful tool that can help you streamline your workflow, improve performance, and work more efficiently. Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale data processing task, our library can help you get the job done.

## Function: `mdadm_mount()`

### Description
The `mdadm_mount()` function is a tool designed to mount all the disks in the JBOD. It returns `1` on success, indicating that the disks were successfully mounted, and `-1` on failure, indicating that the disks are already mounted.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_mount(void);
```

### Parameters
This function takes no parameters.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_mount()` function returns an integer value. It returns `1` on success, indicating that the disks were successfully mounted. If the disks are already mounted, the function returns `-1` to indicate failure.

### Usage
To use the `mdadm_mount()` function, simply call it in your code. Here's an example:

```c
int result = mdadm_mount(); 
if (result == 1) { 
    printf("Disks were successfully mounted.\n"); 
} else if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Disks are already mounted.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("An error occurred while attempting to mount the disks.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we first call the `mdadm_mount()` function and store the result in the `result` variable. We then check the value of `result` to determine whether the disks were successfully mounted, if they were already mounted, or if an error occurred. Based on the result, we print out an appropriate message to the console.

## Function: `mdadm_unmount()`

### Description
The `mdadm_unmount()` function is a tool designed to unmount all the disks in the JBOD. It returns `1` on success, indicating that the disks were successfully unmounted, and `-1` on failure, indicating that the disks were not mounted.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_unmount(void);
```

### Parameters
This function takes no parameters.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_unmount()` function returns an integer value. It returns `1` on success, indicating that the disks were successfully unmounted. If the disks were not mounted, the function returns `-1` to indicate failure.

### Usage
To use the `mdadm_unmount()` function, simply call it in your code. Here's an example:

```c
int result = mdadm_unmount(); 
if (result == 1) { 
    printf("Disks were successfully unmounted.\n"); 
} else if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Disks were not mounted.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("An error occurred while attempting to unmount the disks.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we first call the `mdadm_unmount()` function and store the result in the `result` variable. We then check the value of `result` to determine whether the disks were successfully unmounted or not. Based on the result, we print out an appropriate message to the console.

Note that this function assumes that you have already mounted the disks in the JBOD using the `mdadm_mount()` function. If the disks have not been mounted, you should not call this function, as it will return `-1` to indicate failure.

## Function: `mdadm_read()`

### Description
The `mdadm_read()` function is a tool designed to read data from the disks in the JBOD. It reads data starting from address `addr` for a length of `len`, and puts the data into the buffer pointed to by `buf`. It returns the read data on success and `-1` on failure. The function will fail if `len` is greater than `1024`, if the disks are not mounted, if the address is out of bounds, or if `buf` is `NULL`.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_read(uint32_t addr, uint32_t len, uint8_t *buf);
```

### Parameters
This function takes three parameters:

- `addr`: The starting address from which to read data. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `len`: The length of the data to be read. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `buf`: A pointer to a buffer where the read data will be stored. This parameter is of type `uint8_t*`.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_read()` function returns an integer value. It returns `-1` on failure and the read data on success.

### Usage
To use the `mdadm_read()` function, simply call it in your code and pass in the required parameters. Here's an example:

```c
uint8_t data[1024]; 
int result = mdadm_read(0x1000, 512, data); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Read failed.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Read dataHere is the document content formatted in Markdown so that it can be copied directly into a README file:

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_read(uint32_t addr, uint32_t len, uint8_t *buf);
```

### Parameters
This function takes three parameters:

- `addr`: The starting address from which to read data. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `len`: The length of the data to be read. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `buf`: A pointer to a buffer where the read data will be stored. This parameter is of type `uint8_t*`.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_read()` function returns an integer value. It returns `-1` on failure and the read data on success.

### Usage
To use the `mdadm_read()` function, simply call it in your code and pass in the required parameters. Here's an example:

```c
uint8_t data[1024]; 
int result = mdadm_read(0x1000, 512, data); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Read failed.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Read  "); 
    for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) { 
        printf("%02x ", data[i]); 
    } 
}
```

In this example, we first declare an array `data` to store the read data. We then call the `mdadm_read()` function with the starting address of `0x1000`, a length of `512` bytes, and the `data` array as the buffer to store the read data. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the read was successful or not. If it was successful, we print out the read data to the console in hexadecimal format.

Note that the `mdadm_read()` function will fail if the length is greater than `1024`, if the disks are not mounted, if the address is out of bounds, or if `buf` is `NULL`. Be sure to check the return value of the function to determine whether the read was successful or not.

## Function: `mdadm_write()`

### Description
The `mdadm_write()` function is a tool designed to write data to the disks in the JBOD. It writes data starting from address `addr` for a length of `len`, and the data to be written is provided through the buffer pointed to by `buf`. It returns the written data on success and `-1` on failure. The function will fail if `len` is greater than `1024`, if the disks are not mounted, if the address is out of bounds, or if `buf` is `NULL`.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_write(uint32_t addr, uint32_t len, const uint8_t *buf);
```

### Parameters
This function takes three parameters:

- `addr`: The starting address from which to write data. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `len`: The length of the data to be written. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `buf`: A pointer to a buffer containing the data to be written. This parameter is of type `const uint8_t*`.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_write()` function returns an integer value. It returns `-1` on failure and the written data on success.

### Usage
To use the `mdadm_write()` function, simply call it in your code and pass in the required parameters. Here's an example:

```c
const uint8_t data[512] = { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, ... }; 
int result = mdadm_write(0x1000, 512, data); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Write failed.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Data written successfully.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we first declare an array `data` containing the data to be written. We then call the `mdadm_write()` function with the starting address of `0x1000`, a length of `512` bytes, and the `data` array as the buffer containing the data to be written. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the write was successful or not. If it was successful, we print out a success message to the console.

Note that the `mdadm_write()` function will fail if the length is greater than `1024`, if the disks are not mounted, if the address is out of bounds, or if `buf` is `NULL`. Be sure to check the return value of the function to determine whether the write was successful or not.
