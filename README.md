# MDADM Library Manual

Welcome to the MDADM Library manual. This document provides comprehensive information about the various functions available in the MDADM library, which is designed to enhance your programming projects by offering advanced data management capabilities.

## Introduction

The MDADM library is a robust tool designed to facilitate a wide range of tasks efficiently. It is ideal for data processing, machine learning, or any computationally intensive tasks, simplifying your workflow and enhancing performance.

### Key Features

- **Caching:** Improves performance by storing frequently used data in memory, allowing faster access. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets or complex algorithms.
- **Remote JBOD Access:** Enables you to interact with data on remote JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks) servers as if it were local, eliminating the need for physical data transfer.

## Function: mdadm_mount()

### Description

The `mdadm_mount()` function mounts all disks in the JBOD, facilitating easier data access.

### Syntax

```c
int mdadm_mount(void);
```

### Parameters

This function does not take any parameters.

### Return Value

- Returns `1` on success, indicating successful mounting.
- Returns `-1` on failure, if the disks are already mounted.

### Usage Example

```c
int result = mdadm_mount();
if (result == 1) {
    printf("Disks were successfully mounted.\n");
} else if (result == -1) {
    printf("Disks are already mounted.\n");
} else {
    printf("An error occurred while attempting to mount the disks.\n");
}
```

## Function: mdadm_unmount()

### Description

The `mdadm_unmount()` function is designed to unmount all disks in the JBOD.

### Syntax

```c
int mdadm_unmount(void);
```

### Parameters

This function does not take any parameters.

### Return Value

- Returns `1` on success, indicating successful unmounting.
- Returns `-1` on failure, if the disks were not mounted.

### Usage Example

```c
int result = mdadm_unmount();
if (result == 1) {
    printf("Disks were successfully unmounted.\n");
} else if (result == -1) {
    printf("Disks were not mounted.\n");
} else {
    printf("An error occurred while attempting to unmount the disks.\n");
}
```

## Function: mdadm_read()

### Description

The `mdadm_read()` function reads data from the disks in the JBOD from a specified address into a provided buffer.

### Syntax

```c
int mdadm_read(uint32_t addr, uint32_t len, uint8_t *buf);
```

### Parameters

- `addr`: Starting address from which to read data.
- `len`: Length of the data to be read.
- `buf`: Pointer to the buffer where the read data will be stored.

### Return Value

- Returns `-1` on failure.
- On success, returns the read data.

### Usage Example

```c
uint8_t data[1024];
int result = mdadm_read(0x1000, 512, data);
if (result == -1) {
    printf("Read failed.\n");
} else {
    printf("Read data: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) {
        printf("%02x ", data[i]);
    }
}
```

## Function: mdadm_write()

### Description

The `mdadm_write()` function writes data to the disks in the JBOD from a specified address using data provided in a buffer.

### Syntax

```c
int mdadm_write(uint32_t addr, uint32_t len, const uint8_t *buf);
```

### Parameters

- `addr`: Starting address from which to write data.
- `len`: Length of the data to be written.
- `buf`: Pointer to the buffer containing the data to be written.

### Return Value

- Returns `-1` on failure.
- On success, returns the data written.

### Usage Example

```c
const uint8_t data[512] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, ...};
int result = mdadm_write(0x1000, 512, data);
if (result == -1) {
    printf("Write failed.\n");
} else {
    printf("Data written successfully.\n");
}
```

## Function: mdadm_cache_create()

### Description

Allocates space for a cache of specified number of entries, enhancing read performance.

### Syntax

```c
int mdadm_cache_create(int num_entries);
```

### Parameters

- `num_entries`: Number of cache entries to be allocated.

### Return Value

- Returns `1` on success, indicating cache creation.
- Returns `-1` on failure.

### Usage Example

```c
int result = mdadm_cache_create(100);
if (result == -1) {
    printf("Failed to create cache.\n");
} else {
    printf("Cache created successfully.\n");
}
```

Remember to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()` at the end of your program to avoid memory leaks.

## Function: mdadm_cache_destroy()

### Description

Frees space allocated by `mdadm_cache_create()`, ensuring clean termination of caching.

### Syntax

```c
int mdadm_cache_destroy(void);
```

### Return Value

- Returns `1` on success.
- Returns `-1` on failure.

### Usage Example

```c
int result = mdadm_cache_destroy();
if (result == -1) {
    printf("Failed to destroy cache.\n");
} else {
    printf("Cache destroyed successfully.\n");
}
```
