# mdadm Library Manual

Introducing our library: it's a powerful tool that can help you perform a wide range of tasks quickly and efficiently. Whether you're working with data processing, machine learning, or other computationally intensive tasks, our library is designed to simplify your workflow and help you get the results you need.

One of the key features of our library is caching, which helps to improve performance by storing frequently used data in memory for fast access. This can be particularly useful when working with large datasets or when running complex algorithms that require a lot of computation. With our caching system, you can speed up your workflow and get your results faster than ever before.

In addition to caching, our library also supports working with remote JBOD servers. This means that you can access and work with data stored on remote servers as if they were part of your local system, without needing to physically transfer files or data back and forth. This can be particularly useful if you're working with large data sets that are too big to store on your local machine.

Overall, our library is a versatile and powerful tool that can help you streamline your workflow, improve performance, and work more efficiently. Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale data processing task, our library can help you get the job done.

## Function: `mdadm_mount()`

### Description
The `mdadm_mount()` function is a tool designed to mount all the disks in the JBOD. It returns `1` on success, indicating that the disks were successfully mounted, and `-1` on failure, indicating that the disks are already mounted.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_mount(void);
```

### Parameters
This function takes no parameters.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_mount()` function returns an integer value. It returns `1` on success, indicating that the disks were successfully mounted. If the disks are already mounted, the function returns `-1` to indicate failure.

### Usage
To use the `mdadm_mount()` function, simply call it in your code. Here's an example:

```c
int result = mdadm_mount(); 
if (result == 1) { 
    printf("Disks were successfully mounted.\n"); 
} else if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Disks are already mounted.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("An error occurred while attempting to mount the disks.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we first call the `mdadm_mount()` function and store the result in the `result` variable. We then check the value of `result` to determine whether the disks were successfully mounted, if they were already mounted, or if an error occurred. Based on the result, we print out an appropriate message to the console.

## Function: `mdadm_unmount()`

### Description
The `mdadm_unmount()` function is a tool designed to unmount all the disks in the JBOD. It returns `1` on success, indicating that the disks were successfully unmounted, and `-1` on failure, indicating that the disks were not mounted.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_unmount(void);
```

### Parameters
This function takes no parameters.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_unmount()` function returns an integer value. It returns `1` on success, indicating that the disks were successfully unmounted. If the disks were not mounted, the function returns `-1` to indicate failure.

### Usage
To use the `mdadm_unmount()` function, simply call it in your code. Here's an example:

```c
int result = mdadm_unmount(); 
if (result == 1) { 
    printf("Disks were successfully unmounted.\n"); 
} else if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Disks were not mounted.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("An error occurred while attempting to unmount the disks.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we first call the `mdadm_unmount()` function and store the result in the `result` variable. We then check the value of `result` to determine whether the disks were successfully unmounted or not. Based on the result, we print out an appropriate message to the console.

Note that this function assumes that you have already mounted the disks in the JBOD using the `mdadm_mount()` function. If the disks have not been mounted, you should not call this function, as it will return `-1` to indicate failure.

## Function: `mdadm_read()`

### Description
The `mdadm_read()` function is a tool designed to read data from the disks in the JBOD. It reads data starting from address `addr` for a length of `len`, and puts the data into the buffer pointed to by `buf`. It returns the read data on success and `-1` on failure. The function will fail if `len` is greater than `1024`, if the disks are not mounted, if the address is out of bounds, or if `buf` is `NULL`.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_read(uint32_t addr, uint32_t len, uint8_t *buf);
```

### Parameters
This function takes three parameters:

- `addr`: The starting address from which to read data. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `len`: The length of the data to be read. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `buf`: A pointer to a buffer where the read data will be stored. This parameter is of type `uint8_t*`.

To use the `mdadm_read()` function, simply call it in your code and pass in the required parameters. Here's an example:

```c
uint8_t data[1024]; 
int result = mdadm_read(0x1000, 512, data); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Read failed.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Read  "); 
    for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) { 
        printf("%02x ", data[i]); 
    } 
}
```

In this example, we first declare an array `data` to store the read data. We then call the `mdadm_read()` function with the starting address of `0x1000`, a length of `512` bytes, and the `data` array as the buffer to store the read data. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the read was successful or not. If it was successful, we print out the read data to the console in hexadecimal format.

Note that the `mdadm_read()` function will fail if the length is greater than `1024`, if the disks are not mounted, if the address is out of bounds, or if `buf` is `NULL`. Be sure to check the return value of the function to determine whether the read was successful or not.

## Function: `mdadm_write()`

### Description
The `mdadm_write()` function is a tool designed to write data to the disks in the JBOD. It writes data starting from address `addr` for a length of `len`, and the data to be written is provided through the buffer pointed to by `buf`. It returns the written data on success and `-1` on failure. The function will fail if `len` is greater than `1024`, if the disks are not mounted, if the address is out of bounds, or if `buf` is `NULL`.

### Syntax

This function takes three parameters:

- `addr`: The starting address from which to write data. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `len`: The length of the data to be written. This parameter is of type `uint32_t`.
- `buf`: A pointer to a buffer containing the data to be written. This parameter is of type `const uint8_t*`.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_write()` function returns an integer value. It returns `-1` on failure and the written data on success.

### Usage
To use the `mdadm_write()` function, simply call it in your code and pass in the required parameters. Here's an example:

```c
const uint8_t data[512] = { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, ... }; 
int result = mdadm_write(0x1000, 512, data); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Write failed.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Data written successfully.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we first declare an array `data` containing the data to be written. We then call the `mdadm_write()` function with the starting address of `0x1000`, a length of `512` bytes, and the `data` array as the buffer containing the data to be written. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the write was successful or not. If it was successful, we print out a success message to the console.

Note that the `mdadm_write()` function will fail if the length is greater than `1024`, if the disks are not mounted, if the address is out of bounds, or if `buf` is `NULL`. Be sure to check the return value of the function to determine whether the write was successful or not.

## Function: ` ```markdown
mdadm_cache_create()`

### Description
The `mdadm_cache_create()` function is used to allocate space for a cache of `num_entries` entries, where each entry is of type `cache_entry_t`. This function returns `1` on success and `-1` on failure. It is the function that users should call if they want to use read caching for improved performance.

It's important to note that calling `mdadm_cache_create()` again without first calling `mdadm_cache_destroy()` will result in failure. Also, it's important to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()` at the end to avoid memory leaks.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_cache_create(int num_entries);
```

### Parameters
- `num_entries`: The number of cache entries to be allocated. This parameter is of type `int`.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_cache_create()` function returns an integer value. It returns `1` on success and `-1` on failure.

### Usage
Here's an example usage of the `mdadm_cache_create()` function:

```c
int result = mdadm_cache_create(100); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Failed to create cache.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Cache created successfully.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we're calling `mdadm_cache_create()` with `num_entries` set to 100. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the cache was created successfully or not. If it was, we print a success message to the console.

It's important to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()` at the end of your program to avoid memory leaks:

```c
mdadm_cache_destroy();
```

If you forget to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()`, your program may experience memory leaks.

## Function: `mdadm_cache_destroy()`

### Description
The `mdadm_cache_destroy()` function is used to free the space that was previously allocated by the `mdadm_cache_create()` function. This function returns `1` on success and `-1` on failure.

### Syntax
```c
int mdadm_cache_destroy(void);
```

### Parameters
This function doesn't take any parameters.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_cache_destroy()` function returns an integer value. It returns `1` on success and `-1` on failure.

### Usage
Here's an example usage of the `mdadm_cache_destroy()` function:

```c
int result = mdadm_cache_destroy(); 
if (result == -1) { 
    printf("Failed to destroy cache.\n"); 
} else { 
    printf("Cache destroyed successfully.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we're calling `mdadm_cache_destroy()` to free the space allocated by the `mdadm_cache_create()` function. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the cache was destroyed successfully or not. If it was, we print a success message to the console.

It's important to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()` at the end of your program to avoid memory leaks:

```c
mdadm_cache_destroy();
```

If you forget to call `mdadm_cache_destroy()`, your program may experience memory leaks.

## Function: `mdadm_connect()`

### Description
The `mdadm_connect()` function is used to connect to a server using the provided IP address and port number. This function returns `true` if the connection was successful, and `false` otherwise. It is important to call the `mdadm_disconnect()` function after a successful connection.

### Syntax
```c
bool mdadm_connect(const char *ip, uint16_t port);
```

### Parameters
The `mdadm_connect()` function takes two parameters:

- `ip`: A string containing the IP address of the server to connect to.
- `port`: An unsigned 16-bit integer representing the port number to use for the connection.

### Return Value
The `mdadm_connect()` function returns a boolean value. It returns `true` if the connection was successful, and `false` otherwise.

### Usage
Here's an example usage of the `mdadm_connect()` function:

    printf("Connected to server.\n"); 
 
    // Perform operations on the server here. 
 
    mdadm_disconnect(); 
} else { 
    printf("Failed to connect to server.\n"); 
}
```

In this example, we're calling `mdadm_connect()` to connect to a server with IP address "192.168.1.100" and port number 1234. We then check the return value of the function to determine whether the connection was successful or not. If it was, we print a success message to the console, perform any necessary operations on the server, and then call `mdadm_disconnect()` to disconnect from the server.

It's important to call `mdadm_disconnect()` after a successful connection to ensure that the connection is properly closed and resources are freed:

```c
mdadm_disconnect();
```

If you forget to call `mdadm_disconnect()`, your program may experience issues such as resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Function: `mdadm_disconnect()`

### Description
The `mdadm_disconnect()` function is used to disconnect from a server that was previously connected to using the `mdadm_connect()` function.
